## Learning objectives

-  Understand what multinomial and ordinal logistic regressions are
-  Know the assumptions of multinomial and ordinal logistic regressions
-  Be able to use R to perform multinomial and ordinal logistic regressions
-  Know how to perform hypothesis tests
-  Know how to estimate and interpret estimates from multinomial and ordinal regression models

## What is multinomial logistic regression (MLR)?

-  A form of logistic regression analysis conducted when the dependent variable is nominal with more than two levels (e.g., insurance status, occupation).
-  Also known as multinomial logit model, polytomous logistic regression, multiclass logistic regression, softmax regression, the maximum entropy classifier, and the conditional maximum entropy model.
-  Used to describe data and to explain the relationship between one dependent nominal variable and one or more independent variables. 

## Crucial features

- Suppose our dependent nominal variable y has J levels.
- Estimate a separate binary logistic regression model for each non-reference level of y compared to the reference level of y, therefore the result is J-1 binary logistic regression models.
- Each model conveys the effect of predictors on the probability of success in a non-reference level of y, in comparison to the reference level.

## Link function 

- Take the logarithm of the odds of the probability of y=m versus the probability of y=b, where b is the reference outcome whose coefficients associated with the independent variables are constrained to be zero and m is the target outcome.

## Structural model

![The structural model](Jietu20190220-201749.png)


## Assumptions

- Dependent variable is nominal with more than two levels
- Independence of observations 
- No multicollinearity
- A linear relationship between any continuous independent variables and the logit transformation of the dependent variable
- No outliers or highly influential points (Pregibon's (1981) deltabeta or Cook's distance)


## Example

- Prostate cancer data was downloaded from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER) database, a premier data source for cancer statistics in the US. SEER collects incidence, prevalence and survival data.
- Patients with primary prostate cancer, aged above 18  years with Stage I to IV at diagnosis were included. 
- In this study, we are interested in the effects of insurance status on stage at diagnosis among prostate cancer patients.
- The covariates are comprised of patients' demographics, marital status, and SES.

                                                   "Non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander") ~ "Non-Hispanic Other",
                             TRUE ~ Race_ethnicity),
         Race_cat = factor(Race_cat),
         Race_cat = relevel(Race_cat, ref = "Non-Hispanic White"),

         Poverty_cat = relevel(Poverty_cat, ref = "Low poverty")) %>%
  #Keep primary cancer cases only
  filter(FirstCancer=="Yes")
```


### Drop the cases with missing values on any variables used for complete case analysis

```{r, echo=TRUE,  warning=FALSE}
Complete <- Data %>%
  dplyr::select(Age_num : Poverty_cat) %>%
  drop_na()

MissingRate <-  1- nrow(Complete)/nrow(Data)
#Look at missing rate
MissingRate
```

## Execute a mutilnomial logistic regression

### Below we use the multinom function from the *nnet* package to estimate a multinomial logistic regression model. 
```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#Attach the data to avoid repeatly typing the dataset name 
attach(Complete)
##Re-leveling data, choose stage IV as reference
Stage_cat_re <- relevel(Stage_cat, ref = "IV")

mod <- multinom(Stage_cat_re ~ Insur_cat)
summary(mod)
```

## Interpretations

- *Categorical variable*
- The log odds of being diagnosed at stage I vs. stage IV increased by 0.40 in cases with private insurance compared to those with Medicaid. 
- The log odds of being diagnosed at stage II vs. stage IV increased by 0.70 in cases with private insurance compared to those with Medicaid. 
- The log odds of being diagnosed at stage III vs. stage IV increased by 0.71 in cases with private insurance compared to those with Medicaid. 

## Interpretations (con.)

- To know the effect of *Insured* on the logit of a non-reference outcome relative to another non-refernce outcome (e.g.,stage II vs. stage III)), you can take the difference of the two *coefficients* (0.6987445-0.7059517=-0.0072072).
- Meaning: the log odds of being diagnosed in stage II vs. stage III decreased by 0.007 in those with private insurance compared to those with Medicaid. 
- You can *also* just relevel the reference category as stage II.

## Interpretations (con.)

- Even though 1 set of coefficients is omitted, there are actually more sets of coefficients that we can calculate with simple math. For a model with four outcomes in our case, we have 6 sets of comparisons (i.e., 6 sets of coefficients): 
- - stage IV vs III, stage IV vs II, stage IV vs I
- - stage III vs II, stage III vs I
- - stage II vs I

## Hypothesis test

- No p values are automatically reported in the multinom function.
- Use Z-test to test individual parameter (i.e. β).
- The p-value from this test indicates whether or not we can reject the null hypothesis of β equal to 0 relative to the effect on the reference outcome at a given level of statistical significance (e.g., 0.05). 

```{r, echo=TRUE,  warning=FALSE}
#calculate z score
z <- summary(mod)$coefficients/summary(mod)$standard.errors
# 2-tailed Z test
p <- (1 - pnorm(abs(z), 0, 1))*2
p

#Get confidence intervals for the log odds using confint function
ci <- confint(mod)
ci
```

## Odds ratio and 95% CIs

- Odds ratio can be taken and interpreted in the same way as that from a binary logistic model: OR=exp(β). 

```{r}
## extract the coefficients from the model and exponentiate to get OR
exp(coef(mod))

#get confidence intervals for ORs
exp(confint(mod, level=0.95))
```

## Interpretations
- *Categorical variable*
- The odds of being diagnosed with stage I prostate cancer relative to stage IV is 1.5 times greater for privately insured cases versus those with Medicaid. 

## MLR vs. Binary logistic regression

- MLR estimates a separate binary logistic regression model for each level of y compared to the reference level of y, therefore the result is a chain of binary logistic regression models.
- The binary logistic regression results are shown for the comparisons that only includes the cases with stage I and IV with stage IV as reference category.

```{r}
#Drop the cases with stage II and stage III
bi_logit <- Complete %>%
  filter (Stage_cat %in% c("I", "IV")) %>%
  mutate (Stage_cat_re =relevel(Stage_cat, ref = "IV"))

#Run a binary logistic regression using stage IV as the reference category
mod_bi <- glm(Stage_cat_re ~ Insur_cat, data=bi_logit,family=binomial())

#Get the odds ratio and 95%CIs
exp(cbind("Odds ratio" = coef(mod_bi), confint(mod_bi, level = 0.95)))
```

## Compared with the multinomial logistic regression
- The results are pretty similar.

```{r}
#Extract the results for the comparison group of stage I and stage IV only
exp(coef(mod)[1,])
#confidence intervals 
exp(confint(mod, level=0.95)[1:2,1:2,1])
```

## Adding potential confounders

```{r}
##Execute a mutilnomial regression with insurance as independent variable and demographics as covariates
mod_c <- multinom(Stage_cat_re ~ Insur_cat + Age_num + Race_cat + Marital_cat + Poverty_cat)
summary(mod_c)
## extract the coefficients from the model and exponentiate
exp(coef(mod_c))
#confidence intervals (efficient method, all)
exp(confint(mod_c, level=0.95))
```


## Interpretations

- *Continous variable*
- The odds of being diagnosed with stage I prostate cancer relative to stage IV is 1.02 times greater with each one-year increases in age, holding all other variables constant. 
- *Categorical variable*
- The odds of being diagnosed with stage I prostate cancer relative to stage IV is 1.11 times greater for privately insured cases versus those with Medicaid, holding all other variables constant. 


## Overview of ordinal outcome variables

- Key features of an ordinal variable: it does have a ranking order, but distances between levels are not measurable (e.g. for pain: none, mild, moderate, severe)
- Applying an OLS regression to an ordinal outcome variable is a fatal error
- Alternative models
  - - Binary logistic regression to collapse categories to create a dichotomous outcome
  - - Multinomial logistic regression to ignore the ranking order by treating the outcome as a nominal variable

## Ordinal logistic regression

- Ordinal regression is used to predict the dependent variable with ordered multiple categories (e.g., stage, likert scale) and independent variables. 
- Also known as ordinal logit model, ordered logit model, and proportional odds model.

![Model link function](Picture6.png)


## Assumptions
- Dependent variable should be ordinal variables with more than two levels.
- There is no multicollinearity.
- Have proportional odds or parallel regression.

![Parallel regression assumption](Picture4.png)

## Execute an ordinal logistic regression

```{r, echo=TRUE,  warning=FALSE}
mod1 <- polr(Stage_cat ~ Insur_cat,Hess=TRUE) 

summary(mod1)
```

## Hypothesis test

- Use Z-test to test individual parameter 
- The p-value from such test indicates whether or not we can reject the null hypothesis of β equal to 0 at a given level of statistical significance. 

```{r}
## store table
ctable <- coef(summary(mod1))
## calculate and store p values
p <- pnorm(abs(ctable[, "t value"]), lower.tail = FALSE) * 2
p
## combined table
ctable <- cbind(ctable, "p value" = p)
ctable
# default method gives profiled CIs
ci <- confint(mod1) 
ci
```

## Get the odds ratio and 95%CIs

```{r}
## odds ratios and 95%CIs
exp(cbind("Odds ratio" = coef(mod1), confint.default(mod1, level = 0.95)))
```
## Interpretations 
- Exp(β) above was estimated, meaning compare odds from low to high.
*Categorical variable*
- The odds of being diagnosed at stage IV are 0.64 times the odds of being diagnosed at *stages III to I* for patients with private insurance than those with Medicaid.
- *or*
- The odds of being diagnosed at *stage IV and III* are 0.64 times the odds of being diagnosed at *stages II and I* for patients with private insurance than those with Medicaid. 
- *or*
- The odds of being diagnosed at *stage IV to II* are 0.64 times the odds of being diagnosed at *stages I* for patients with private insurance than those with Medicaid. 

## Interpretations 
- If the Exp(-β) above was estimated, meaning compare odds from high to low.

```{r}
## odds ratios and 95%CIs
exp(cbind("Odds ratio" = -coef(mod1)))
```

## Interpretations 
- *Categorical variable*
- The odds of being diagnosed at stage I are 1.57 times the odds of being diagnosed at *stages II to IV* for patients with private insurance than those with Medicaid.
- *or*
- The odds of being diagnosed at *stage I and II* are 1.57 times the odds of being diagnosed at *stages III and IV* for patients with private insurance than those with Medicaid.
- *or*
- The odds of being diagnosed at *stage I to III* are 1.57 times the odds of being diagnosed at *stages IV* for patients with private insurance than those with Medicaid. 

## Execute an ordinal logistic regression with potential confounders

```{r, echo=TRUE,  warning=FALSE}
mod1_c <- polr(Stage_cat ~ Insur_cat + Age_num + Race_cat + Marital_cat + Poverty_cat, Hess=TRUE)
## odds ratios and 95%CIs
exp(cbind("Odds ratio" = coef(mod1_c), confint.default(mod1_c, level = 0.95)))
```

## Interpretations 

- Exp(β) above was estimated, meaning compare odds from low to high.
- Examples
- *Continous variable*
- The odds of being diagnosed at *stage IV* is 1.02 times the Odds of being diagnosed at *stages I to III* with each one-year increases in age, holding all other variables constant. 
 *or*
- The odds of being diagnosed at *stages IV and III* is 1.02 times the odds of being diagnosed at *stages I and II* with each one-year increase in age, holding all other variables constant. 
 *or*
- The odds of being diagnosed at *stages IV to II* is 1.02 times the odds of being diagnosed at *stage I* with each one-year increase in age, holding all other variables constant. 

## Interpretations 

- *Categorical variable*
- The odds of being diagnosed at stage IV are 0.65 times the odds of being diagnosed at *stages III to I* for patients with private insurance than those with Medicaid at diagnosis, holding all other variables constant.
 *or*
- The odds of being diagnosed at *stages IV and III* are 0.65 times the odds of being diagnosed at *stages II and I* for patients with private insurance than those with Medicaid at diagnosis, holding other variables constant. 
 *or*
- The odds of being diagnosed at *stages IV to II* are 0.65 times the odds of being diagnosed at *stage I* for patients with private insurance than those with Medicaid at diagnosis, holding other variables constant. 


## Notes about parallel regression assumption
- In most real-world datasets, this assumption is violated.
- All tests are sensitive to other types of misspecification.
- When the assumption is violated, the researchers need to consider using alternative models that do not impose the constraint of parallel regressions, such as a multinomial logitistic model.
- Therefore, the suggestion is that don’t worry about the parallel regression assumption, but always use the multinomial logistic model as a robust check for ordinal logistic model.

## Comparing results between multinomial and ordinal logistic regression
- The direction of the effect is consistent. 

```{r}
#multinomial logistic regression
exp(coef(mod))
#ordinal logistic regression
